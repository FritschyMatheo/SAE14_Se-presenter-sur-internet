          <h3>What is calisthenics?</h3>
          <p>
            The word «calisthenics» is made of 2 greecs words, Kalos which means
            beauty, it shows the artistic side of the discipline and Sthenos
            which means strength, for the mental and physique strength and the
            determination. It can be translated by "The beauty of strength".
          </p>
          <p>
            This sport is made of different branches that come from America and
            the East. These branches are in development because they are really
            recent.
          </p>
          <p>
            The earliest traces of this sport can be found in early 19th century
            in Sweden. Calisthenics can be seen combining classical flexibility
            and agility exercises with more strength ones. The first nomination
            could come from an american school teacher, Catharine Esther
            Beecher. She has written a book entitled "Physiology And
            Calisthenics: For Schools And Families" which aims to understand the
            functions of the human body and shows the importance of physical
            exercise. In fact, she has introduced into her classes a form of
            gymnastics which, like calisthenics, works on flexibility but also
            develops bodyweight strength. Her work and her approach to sport are
            also aimed at achieving a healthy lifestyle.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, until the 21st century, there didn't seem to be anything
            new in the discipline. But in 2008, the American Hannibal Lanham,
            aka Hannibal For Kings, posted
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfsTKfUT-RQ">a video</a>
            of one of his workouts, which garnered millions of views on youtube.
            After that, Street Workout was born. This is another common name for
            callisthenics, but it actually refers to practising one of the
            branches of callisthenics, which will be presented in detail later,
            but on the street.

            <h3>My practice</h3>
            <p>
              I have trained Set and Reps way before I discovered the
              calisthenics. I got motivated by a friend in the 6th grad and
              started doing push-ups and some basic bodyweight exercises such as
              gainage. That said, I wasn't at all consistent about my workouts
              and didn't really know what I was doing. This period lasted until
              around 2021, when, after coronavirus, I discovered what was
              possible by training using only my own body weight. That's when I
              started working on the fundamentals, mainly L-sit and pull-ups.<br />
              I progressed fairly quickly, doing a lot of pull-ups at home on a
              Roman chair and in parks with friends. Unfortunately, I had less
              active training periods... But since the start of the 2022 school
              year, I've been very active. I got my first muscle-ups in February
              with pretty poor form and recently managed to do some in "Slow"
              which means in slow motion so without momentum. At the same time
              I'm working on the Front Lever, but it's a very complicated skill
              to start with. For a while now I've been working on a single-leg
              form and I can almost hold the full version for two seconds.
            </p>
            <h3>My goals</h3>
            <p>
              My goals now are to get the Front Lever, improve my strength in
              pull-ups and push (push-ups and semi-planche) and then catch up in
              handstand. I've still got a long way to go to my final goal, which
              is to do Pelican Pushups. This exercise is... extremely difficult.
              Mainly performed on rings, it consists in doing a sort of pump but
              starting from a Full Plank and descending to a supinated Back
              Lever and then rising again.
