        <h3>My journey and me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Mathéo Fritschy and I'm currently a student in my first
          year of a "BUT Réseaux et Télécommunications" at the university of
          Colmar. On this page, I'm going to tell you about my curent career and
          over the next few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, I started high school at Champagnat Issenheim, where I
          obtained my brevet with honors in 2020. I then joined the Lycée
          Professionnel Saint Jean in Colmar for a BAC Professionnel Systèmes
          Numériques with a Network option. I really enjoyed the course,
          especially the practical work on networks and server and workstation
          installation. I also got to see a bit of Linux with Raspberry Pi for
          example. Right now, I am in Colmar for the Networks and
          Telecommunications BUT, as the course is a continuation of what I was
          able to do in practical work at Saint Jean, and I'm enjoying it so
          far.

        <h3>My professional experience</h3>
        <p>
          During my BAC Pro training, I had the opportunity to do several
          internships, which formed a large part of my work experience. I was
          also able to work with my father during the summer vacations in air
          conditioning maintenance.

        <h3>My internships projects</h3>
        <p>
          So I've been able to acquire a lot of knowledge during my various
          internships and training courses. I've learned how to be rigorous at
          work, and how to behave in a company and with customers. On a
          technical level, although this isn't my field, I do have some
          knowledge of air conditioning operation and repair. During my
          internships, I was able to install a lot of Windows workstations and a
          few Linux ones. I've also had some interesting projects:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Wifi repeater configuration and installation (ABC Réseau)</h4>
            <p>
              During this project, my internship supervisor and I took
              measurements of a warehouse's wifi network with a view to
              installing a repeater. Here's a diagram of the results obtained:
            </p>
            <div class="images-pro">
              <img
                src="../Images/Pro/plan-wifi1.png"
                alt="plan-wifi1"
                width="50%"
              />
            </div>
            <p>
              We then configured a Mikrotik hAP ac² router to map the company's
              2.4 and 5GHz network. Here's the configuration:
            </p>
            <div id="configuration">
              <p>
                DHCP Client on Bridge, disable DHCP Server, no firewall changes
                required, disable www, telnet and ftp for network security. Also
                disable the Bridge's eth2 interface.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              With this configuration, by setting the SSID and password of the
              cap AC router already present in the company, all you had to do
              was plug the router into the network and power it up, and it would
              connect itself and relay the 2.4 and 5GHz signals. <br />
              Here's the result after setting up the access point:
            </p>
            <div class="images-pro">
              <img
                src="../Images/Pro/plan-wifi2.png"
                alt="plan-wifi2"
                width="50%"
              />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Automated and customized Windows installation (ABC Réseau)</h4>
            <p>
              I carried out this project almost autonomously over a two-week
              period, while doing other tasks at the same time. So I'm going to
              explain here how to create an automatic Windows installation USB
              key with a clean OS.<br />
              To do this, I first needed to make a clean Windows ISO, which I
              modified with DISM++, a graphical interface to DISM, a tool for
              managing Windows images. Once the ISO was ready, I needed to
              automate the installation, by adding an XML file that can be
              generated on certain sites such as "windowsafg" for my part. The
              resulting file was to be placed at the root of the bootable key
              created with Rufus.<br />
              I've seen that you can automatically install software directly
              after installing the operating system. So you need to have
              executable software files and call them up in a batch script,
              which has itself been launched in the XML file you've inserted in
              the root. With the following line:
            </p>
            <div class="images-pro">
              <img
                src="../Images/Pro/appel-commande.png"
                alt="appel-commande"
              />
              <p>And here's the Batch script:</p>
              <img src="../Images/Pro/script-batch.png" alt="script" />
            </div>
            <p>
              So, when you launch Windows installation with this bootable key,
              the answer file responds to installation questions on its own and
              launches the software installers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Cable management of part of an open space (Agence Cactus)</h4>
            <p>
              At the "AgenceCactus", I was able to reorganize the layout of the
              open-plan offices and arrange the cables. When I arrived, the
              cables weren't tidy, some were lying on the floor and chairs were
              rolling over them. So I was given the task of tidying them up. I
              was able to order and install my own cable brackets to fix under
              the desk, as well as cable ties.<br />
              Here are the desks after my installation:
            </p>
            <div class="images-pro">
              <img src="../Images/Pro/cables-2.png" alt="bureaux" />
              <img src="../Images/Pro/cables-1.png" alt="bureaux2" />
            </div>
            <p>
              The people working in the open space were happy with the work I'd
              done.

            <h4>Configuration d'une GED (ABC Réseau)</h4>
            <p>
              For my last internship at ABC Réseau, I had the opportunity to
              configure an
              <strong>Electronic Document Management (EDM)</strong> installed in
              a Docker on a Proxmox server. The aim was to set up a document
              manager for a company with different sales reps for different
              regions. Each sales rep was to have access only to the documents
              for his or her region. To achieve this, the company planned to
              work on the Mayan EDMS.<br />
              To answer the problem, we first had to understand how Mayan
              worked, and find out which functionalities would enable us to do
              what we wanted. We started by looking at document types, but these
              are used first and foremost to distinguish invoices from plans,
              for example. Next, we tried to set permissions on indexes, but
              although the user could no longer see the documents, they still
              had access to them.<br />
              The features I ended up using were metadata to distinguish
              regions, workflows for permissions, and roles, groups and users. A
              workflow consists in setting a state for a document by means of
              transitions. Permissions can be associated with each state, and
              transitions can be triggered by metadata.
            </p>
            <div class="images-pro" id="MAYAN">
              <img src="../Images/Pro/plan-mayan.png" alt="MAYAN-Plan" />
              <img src="../Images/Pro/schema-mayan.png" alt="MAYAN-Schema" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Each region has a branch for granting access to its role, so if
              you add more, you need to think carefully about the granting
              action each time. If you have a label, you need to put it on
              right, so as not to have a problem with security access to too
              many documents, or with the wrong label.
