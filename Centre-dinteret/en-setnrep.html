        <h3>What is Set and Reps ?</h3>
        <p>
          Set and Reps, also known as "Set n Reps", is a better-known facet of
          callisthenics, or at least its exercises. The exercises in this branch
          are :
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pushups</li>
          <li>Dips</li>
          <li>Pullups</li>
          <li>Squats</li>
          <li>(Muscle ups)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The goal of the Set and Reps is to perform the cleanest repetition
          possible and to do either as many as possible for endurance, or as
          many as possible in the shortest possible time, which works on
          explosiveness. As you may have noticed, leg exercises are not very
          present in callisthenics, which is one of the sport's weak points. The
          name comes from the words "Sets" and "reps".<br />
          This category is in fact the basis of callisthenics, and as a beginner
          it is often advisable to start here to create a good base before
          moving on to ballasting or more complicated skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are also variants of these exercices that could also be
          classified in this category, such as the one-arm or one-leg variants
          of these movements: The pistol squat, single-arm pull-up or single-arm
          pump. You can also change the support or the grip, such as dips on a
          straight bar, or pull-ups in a neutral grip or on rings. The muscle-up
          has been bracketed above, as it's already a more advanced and less
          widespread movement, but some practitioners still include it in the
          sport. In competition, execution is supervised by referees to prevent
          cheating.<br />
