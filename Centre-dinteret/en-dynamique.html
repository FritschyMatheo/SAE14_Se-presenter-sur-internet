        <h3>What is dynamic?</h3>
        <p>
          Dynamics may not immediately spring to mind when you think of
          callisthenics or Street Workout, but it's part of it too. Unlike
          static, which involves standing figures, dynamic is all about doing
          the most impressive and complex movements around a fairly long pull-up
          bar. This is a rather frightening category, since it's easier to
          injure yourself, and the movements are quickly very impressive. For
          example, there's the "360", which consists of creating momentum and
          then going backwards, letting go of the bar, then turning 360° and
          catching the bar again. Not all figures require you to let go of the
          bar, but there are quite a few. You can compare it to the high bar in
          gymnastics, except that it's not made of wood and isn't always long.
          You have to adapt to the environment.

          Since I don't know that much about dynamics, I'm not going to do a
          gallery here, but here are 3 fairly well-known basic figures:
